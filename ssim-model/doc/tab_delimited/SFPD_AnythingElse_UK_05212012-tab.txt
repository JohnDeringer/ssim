CM1	CM1	652.8	655.9	uh it's uh,

CM1	CM1	749.2	757.6	if i was five minutes later i would have been cleared out. if i was five minutes earlier i would have not had to be doing this right now. 
CM1	CM1	758.3	768.4	uh well i mean uh sh- is- it should i call you guys later today to uh are you guys gonna run the license plate? see if you can visit them at their place? or what the car's registered to? are you guys gonna (())?
