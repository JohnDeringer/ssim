          i didn't lock it or anything. i 
          you know just pretty much went 
          around the corner actually. and 
          like i looked back and there's a 
          car pulled over next to it that 
          read buick uh 
          %license_plate_number and (()) for 
          one license plate i believe. and 
          there's a guy in my car (()) my 
          truck grabbing stuff. {man calling 
          for a taxi in the background} so i 
          go run over there and and uh the 
          guy uh and h- he had a girl in the 
          car too. they like you know who he 
          know grabbed whatever they had had 
          in their hand and just peeled out. 
          and uh i yelled for uh nine one 
          one. i had to you know get in my 
          truck. you know close the doors 
          and everything. i tried to follow 
          them. i mean i didn't know where 
          they went. they turned right in 
          the neighborhood. that's all i
