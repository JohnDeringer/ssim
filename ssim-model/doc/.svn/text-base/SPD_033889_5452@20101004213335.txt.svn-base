          (57.15)

IM2       jesus fuck ((it's christmas city 
          or they're pretty nervous))?

IM1       well you are in the i._d.. so 
          basically (()) narcotic to play 
          here and ((wheel in front)) just 
          as described by the 
          ((complainant)) because we're like 
          right there when the call comes 
          in. they said four guys out front 
          doing narcotics. we roll up 
          there's three guys out ((front)). 
          mister happy here has a bunch of 
          cash in his hand and everybody's 
          huddled around him. soon as we 
          pull up even before we stop 
          they're doing the scatter thing. 
          so we ((call)) them all over the 
          car ((and)) they say what we do 
          what we do what we do? so ((i 
          take)) them over to the car and as 
          he's doing he dropped the shit but 
          the three two i don't have the 
          time to figure out what it is he's 
          dropping. i tried to pick up one 
          thing and looked at it and as soon 
          as i do that he kind of sweeps to 
          the side and i guess he was 
          lighting a cigarette is what he 
          was doing but it he was clearly a 
          he turned his back to us. maybe in 
          the guise of lighting a cigarette 
          maybe doing something else. we 
          don't know. tell him no not to do 
          it. reach up to take the cigarette 
          from him. ((hands do does)) one of 
          these things. tenses up. both up 
          hands come up in fists. no no. i 
          go around on the other side. try 
          to take his cigarette away from 
          him. dude is strong like a horse. 
          i mean i'm putting my body weight 
          on his arm and i'm not moving it. 
          try so i'm trying to tell him to 
          take away the cigarette and put 
          him back on the car. he bucks up 
          and actually moves me back a 
          couple of steps. so i say get on 
          the ground. get on the ground. 
          okay i will. no i'm not. does this 
          thing back and forth. both of his 
          arms are reared up. clearly (()) 
          like this and i'm afraid i'm about 
          to get struck. you got one arm. i 
          got the arm. we're not making any 
          progress whatsoever. so i take his 
          stuff back, 

CM1       stuffed it in his front pants 
          pocket. {background noise of pills 
          in bottle} in his in his trousers. 
          he's got a case in his left hand 
          with a watch on. he's got a case 
          in his left hand with a watch on. 
          {noise of heavy breathing} now 
          they're holding their maglites 
          ((leaving)) like they're gonna 
          come and hit me. knock me out. 
          turned off recording or what? 
          {noise of movement in back seat} 
          fun- found all the dope planted on 
          me?

IF1       yeah. he was lighting a cigarette 
          (()).
          (37.95)

IF1       yeah. he grabbed my wrist. 

IF1       uh yeah he was grabbing my wrist. 
          yeah. that was early on in the 
          scuffle. 

IM1       oh did he grab your wrist? i 
          didn't see that. 

Radio     (()) one. three david one. (()). 
          received. 

IM1       okay. 
          (0.25)

IM1       yeah so it you know he's not going 
          with the program. both hands in 
          fists. still look like it's about 
          to go to blows any second. i take 
          a step back. fire the first taser 
          application. not great because i'm 
          too close. couldn't get a great 
          ((thread)). start trying to 
          ((the)) third point of contact. i 
          mean you can see it's not helpful 
          for him but it's not having the 
          effect i want. he starts ((to 
          walk)) i mean after he's striking 
          towards my hand and the taser. so 
          i back off reload the second one. 
          hit him. uh we're day- doing the 
          dance for a little while and it 
          was more than three cycles. ((i'll 
          do that one when i get into play 
          abducting. i may as well)) but it 
          was more than three ((so it's hard 
          to call you)). (()) looking 
          instead of screaming and 
          everything. 

CM1       his. 
          (0.3)

IF1       and it was like going back and 
          forth. 
          (17.9)

IM2       breathing. 

IM1       (()) already come and gone. uh so 
          then we've managed to get him over 
          and at the third point of contact 
          to the uh butt cheek that got his 
          attention and he really did not 
          like that but i had to order him 
          seven eight times to put his hands 
          behind his back. put your hands 
          behind your back. put your hands 
          behind your back. finally i found 
          a nerve back there and his right 
          hand came whipping back and i got 
          that secured and then he starts 
          again flailing his left hand 
          forward not giving his hand. not 
          giving his hand. so i applied the 
          taser again between his shoulder 
          blade. finally (()) that hand and 
          get him handcuffed and basically 
          pulled him there until the other 
          ((unit)) can get here.

IF1       yeah. 
          (5.4)

CM1       ((he)). 
          (1.8)

CM1       he's a sergeant that they're 
          talking to. he has a case in his 
          right arm that he's opening and 
          shoving evidence into his left 
          left arm. {noise of heavy 
          breathing} all left arm ((sorry. 
          you)) moved. 

IM2       so originally the call was you 
          know narcotic activity going on 
          and he was one of the three people 
          that the guy,

          cleaned him out. all of the cash 
          and everything he put on his car 
          everything that he dropped is 
          magically hoovered up and gone. 
          so,
